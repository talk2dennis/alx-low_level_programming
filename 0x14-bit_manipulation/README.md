# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

## Language: **c**

### *Author* Dennis Adigwe

0. Task 0.0
> Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
> - Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);
> - where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars

1. Task 1.1
> Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
> - void print_binary(unsigned long int n);

2. Task 2.2
> Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
> - int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);

3. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
> - int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);

4. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
> - Prototype: int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
